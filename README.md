1. Fixed a closing bracket on line 37 stopping the code from working propperly
2. Added this readme
3. Added a functional formValidade now things can be added and the validation should only go through the PHP
4. There are a lot of deprecated code and I'm not sure what is suoposed to work, but that's due for another day...
